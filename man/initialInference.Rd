\item{obj}{A BSRDataModelComp object.}

\item{rank.p}{A number between 0 and 1 defining the rank of the last
considered target genes.}

\item{min.cor}{The minimum Spearman correlation required between
the ligand and the receptor.}

\item{restrict.genes}{A list of gene symbols that restricts ligands and
receptors.}

\item{reference}{Which pathway reference should be used ("REACTOME"
for Reactome, "GOBP" for GO Biological Process,
or "REACTOME-GOBP" for both).}

\item{max.pw.size}{Maximum pathway size to consider from the pathway
reference.}

\item{min.pw.size}{Minimum pathway size to consider from the pathway
reference.}

\item{min.positive}{Minimum number of target genes to be found in a given
pathway.}

\item{restrict.pw}{A list of pathway IDs to restrict the application of
the function.}

\item{with.complex}{A logical indicating whether receptor co-complex
members should be included in the target genes.}

\code{\link[multtest]{mt.rawp2adjp}}.}

the inference.}

and the receptor.}

\item{min.logFC}{The minimum log2 fold-change allowed for
both the receptor and the ligand.}

\item{neg.receptors}{A logical indicating whether receptors are only
allowed to be upregulated (FALSE), or up- and downregulated (TRUE).}

\item{pos.targets}{A logical imposing that all the network targets must
display positive logFC, i.e. logFC >= min.t.logFC.}

\item{neg.targets}{A logical imposing that all the network targets must
display negative logFC, i.e. logFC <= - min.t.logFC.}

\item{min.t.logFC}{The minimum log2 fold-change allowed for
targets in case pos.targets or neg.targets are used.}

\item{use.full.network}{A logical to avoid limiting the reference network
to the detected genes and use the whole reference network.}

Computes putative LR interactions along with their statistical confidence.
The analysis is based on P-values associated to the regulation of
genes/proteins in a comparison of two clusters of samples.
In this initial inference, all the relevant pathways are reported,
see reduction functions to reduce this list.
}
\details{
Perform the initial ligand-receptor inference. Initial means that
no reduction is applied. All the (ligand, receptor, downstream pathway)
triples are reported, i.e., a given LR pair may appear multiple times
with different pathways downstream the receptor. Specific reduction
functions are available from the package to operate subsequent
simplifications based on the BSRInference object created by the initial
inference.

Parameters defining minimum/maximum pathway sizes, etc. are set to NULL
by default, meaning that their values will be taken from what was set
during the training of the statistical model with
\code{"\link[=BSRDataModel-class]{learnParameters}"}

To use different
values at the time of inference sounds like a bad idea, although this
could be used to explore without retraining the underlying model.
Retraining of the model with adjusted parameters is advised following
such an exploration.

Perform the initial ligand-receptor inference. Initial means that
no reduction is applied. All the (ligand, receptor, downstream pathway)
triples are reported, i.e., a given LR pair may appear multiple times
with different pathways downstream the receptor. Specific reduction
functions are available from the package to operate subsequent
simplifications based on the BSRInferenceComp object created by this method.

Here, ligand-receptor interactions are inferred based on gene or protein
regulation-associated P-values when comparing two clusters of samples. Since
a BSRDataModelComp object can contain several such comparisons, the name
of the comparison to use must be specified (parameter \code{cmp.name}).

Note that since the introduction of the use.full.network parameter
(April 29, 2024), the pathway sizes are always computed before potential
intersection with the observed data (use.full.network set to FALSE) for
consistency. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum pathway default values
have been raised from 5 & 200 to 10 & 1000 respectively. By default,
use.full.network is set to TRUE, meaning no intersection and hence larger
pathways.
