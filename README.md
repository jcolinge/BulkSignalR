## Overview

BulkSignalR is used to infer ligand-receptor (L-R) interactions from bulk
expression (transcriptomics/proteomics) data, or spatial
transcriptomics. Potential L-R interactions are taken from the
LR*db* database, which is  included in our other package SingleCellSignalR,
available from Bioconductor [here](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellSignalR.html).

Inferences rely on a statistical model linking potential
L-R interactions with biological pathways from Reactome or biological
processes from GO.

A number of visualization and data summary functions are proposed to
help navigating the predicted interactions.
